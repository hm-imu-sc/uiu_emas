# UIU EMAS
UIU EMAS short form of UIU Event Management and Archiving System is a platform that will allow us to host the events systematically and virtually which is one of the key features of this platform. Here, we are focusing on two key events of United International University, CSE Project Show and Club Forum Fest. Due to the Pandemic situation, we could not organize the project show and as well as the club forum fest, as a result, many good projects were not recognized properly or other students don’t know about those projects and obviously, we missed some awesome events of club forum fest. When we want to do any kind of creative work in a particular field, we need to know the related works that have been done previously. Similarly, before selecting a project idea for the courses or personal project, we will get benefited if we can get to know the previous projects that have been done by the UIU students which will help us to generate new ideas or extend some project works. So, day by day we can get some projects from the students of UIU that can have a good impact and add some value to society. UIU EMAS will help the students to do so by achieving the events on this platform. Moreover, we will achieve the club forum fest, so that after graduation one can flashback his/her memories in UIU.<br><br>
