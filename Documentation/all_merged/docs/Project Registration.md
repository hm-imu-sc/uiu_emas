For registering your project for the CSE project show, you have to be an **authenticated student**. Let's go step by step.

* After filling up the **short description** of the project, now it's time to add **team members**. To add your team members you need to write his/her ***student ID*** in the `textbox` which is shown in the picture. If the student is **not registered** in UIU EMAS using his/her ***student ID***, then you'll see a `message` saying that no student was found with that particular ID as shown in the picture.
